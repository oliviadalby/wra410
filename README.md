# Assignment: One HTML and CSS

For this assignment, you will clone Dr. John Monberg's wra410 repository.

You will update your README.md file so that I can learn about the changes you made.

This is a change I am making. This is another change.

If I can't find your changes, I can't give you credit for them

Revise the following section in your README.md file with a short description of what you've accomplished.

## Required Changes to WRA 410

1. Make changes to the background color of a page and a div.
  I changed the Student Groups div to whitesmoke and the background to lightgray-- my eyes are strained by white screens, so I wanted to see if this would make it easier. 


2. Use a new font.
    Switched to Trebuchet MS! It's sans-serif and web-friendly so it should hold up pretty well across browsers.

3. Include two images.
    Added images to the homepage! Honestly, I thought the site looked cleaner prior to adding these, but they are here now.

4. Use a table to format the Grading Scale on the Assignments page.
    I kept the table pretty simple so there would be a clear correlation between the percentage and GPA. I wanted to include a brief description on what would have constituted for each grade, but didn't think I had the authority to make those assumptions.

5. Reformat the Student Groups. Use a different color for links, add a title for each group, seperate each student. Use multiple columns for the divs.  
  I got the sense that there was a very specific vision for how the student groups were meant to be reformatted and I just couldn't see it in my head so I went with a layout that made sense to me? I made a clearer divide between each student and cleaned up the alignment so it would look more organized. At one point, I sketched out a version that involved a 3x2 grid, but I didn't find that it's organization was superior enough to warrant the effort.

6. Add navigation to the Schedule webpage.
  Moved over the navigation present on the rest of the website to the Schedule page.

7. Revise the rows and columns on the Schedule webpage so the information is clearer or prettier.
  I'm a little concerned that the revision isn't going to show up for you the way it does for me on Dreamweaver, but my Schedule page now follows a more horizontal format like that of the Student Group page-- it could look better, but to me, the drop-down organization makes more sense and I think it looks more natural with the navigation.
